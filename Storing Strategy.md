# Storing states
- We can use ascii values for each coordinate to occupy less space, as the coordinates are limited to 64 we would need only two places to represent the state of majority of pirates
- We can store that in the team signal or the signal of the pirate
- Also PS: in the ActTeam function we can see all pirates' signals
