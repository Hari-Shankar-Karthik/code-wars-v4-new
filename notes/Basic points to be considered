Define a variable to store the location of each island (mostly the coordinates of the center square of the island)
There are two ways to win a game... one is to you play your game and you win and the other is by not letting your enemy to win. We have to do both. So whenever our opponent starts to capture an island our pirated should be getting that information and depending upon other factors like whether wall is built or not we will decide which pirate has to move where , but here the point is that the pirate should be aware of such things in each and every timeframe. whenever we encounter a situation where our enemy is capturing any island then we have to check the timeframes which has passes since they started capturing. This has to be done by the pirate in every timeframe.
defender pirate should be outside the island to ensure that no enemy pirates enter the island
